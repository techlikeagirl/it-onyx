        </div>
        <div class="about-cont">
            <p> Welcome to Buffalo River Rentals and Excursions! We are Thomas Wallace and Bruce Bauer, two long-time friends and outdoor enthusiasts who want to provide you with everything you need to have one of the best outdoor adventures of your life experiencing nature along the Buffalo National River in Arkansas. Floating the Buffalo has been a beloved pastime in our area for generations and It’s where some of our most cherished memories with our families and friends have been made. The awe-inspiring natural beauty found around the river and the unforgettable moments we've experienced while on excursions throughout this area are the heart and soul of why we started our company.

                Starting out with just 4 canoes, 10 life vests, and a dream - we built our excursion business from the ground up relying on our immense knowledge of our local wilderness and our passion for showing the best parts of it to others.  
                
                Today we offer full trip planning with canoe and cabin rentals as well as shuttle buses to and from the river sites. We rent canoes that are made locally and are proud to support other local, authentically Arkansan businesses as well. If you would prefer to buy your own canoe rather than rent ours, Bufffalo Canoe Manufacturing is just right up the road from our primary location, tell them Thomas and Bruce sent you!</p>
                
                
                <p class="about-p-btm">As outdoor guides, excursionists, and all-around nature lovers - we understand our role in preserving the environment for us to enjoy now and for future generations. Our goal is to share our love for the outdoors with others while also doing our part to protect it. Leave no trace.
                
                We invite everyone to let us show you around. We are family-friendly and open to all people, of all ages, from everywhere! Please call our office or submit a contact form to discuss disability accommodations, we would love to see how we could assist with any needs you have. We believe nature is for everyone.
                
                Over the years we have grown quite a bit and we are expanding our operations to include more exciting outdoor activities including Mountain Biking, Rock Climbing, Hiking, and more. If there’s something you want to do and don’t see listed on our roster currently,  just ask and we will see if it’s something we can help you with.
                
                Thank you for considering our company for your outdoor adventures. We look forward to welcoming you to the Buffalo National River and sharing our passion for the outdoors with you.
